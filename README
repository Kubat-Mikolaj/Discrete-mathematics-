zadanie 2.  is about writing a program that implements functions:
- entering the function n times in tables;
- constructing a boolean expression that corresponds to the entered boolean function
- optimizing boolean expressions
-constructing logical networks that implement optimized Boolean expressions (constructing logical networks for optimized expressions can be performed in available software)

zadanie 3.  write a program e that implements such functions:
- introduction of graphs of the selected type, given by the adjacency or incident matrix (and for weighted graphs, additional input of weights)
- implementation of the selected algorithm for the above type of graphs
